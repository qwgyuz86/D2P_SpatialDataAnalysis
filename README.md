# D2P_SpatialDataAnalysis

In 2021 Dec, I participated in the D2P (Data to Policy) Symposium hosted by the Auraria Library and University of Colorado Denver.

My project submission title is Residential Ethnic Clusters in Denver

This repository contains the code, paper, slidedeck and recording of my presentation.

Here's the link to the archive of my submission:
